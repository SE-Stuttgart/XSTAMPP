		<h1>Using the Causal Factors Table </h1>
		<h3>Adding a Causal Factor </h3>
			After finishing the Control Structure, each Node of the Control Structure can be used in 
			the Causal Factors Table to add a Causal Factor to it. Press   in the column labeled 
			“Causal Factor” to do so.  
		<h3>Link a Hazard to a Causal Factor </h3>
			Causal Factors can be linked to Hazards. Press   in the column labeled “Hazard Links” 
			to do so. It’s the same linking procedure as described for the Unsafe Control Actions 
			Table. 
		<h3>Define or Link Safety Constraint corresponding to a Causal Factor </h3>
			New Safety Constraints can be defined for Causal Factors as they can be for Unsafe 
			Control Actions. To do so, press   in the column labeled as “Safety Constraint”. If this 
			Safety Constraint was already defined in the Corresponding Safety Constraints Table, it 
			should not be defined one more time. Press   to link to existing Safety Constraints.
