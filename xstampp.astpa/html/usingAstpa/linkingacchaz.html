		<h3>Accident and Hazard Mode </h3>
			If accidents and Hazards were added, they can be linked to each other in the linking 
			view. While in accident mode, accidents can be selected from the big list in the middle of 
			the window to show all Hazards available for linking. By clicking on <img src="../images/linkingSwitch.png">
			 the big list in the middle can be used to select a Hazard in order to show all accidents 
			available for linking. You can switch between Hazard and accident mode anytime while 
			in linking view.  
		<h3>Linking Procedure </h3>
			Linking Hazards to an accident will now be explained while in accident mode: Select an 
			accident from the big list in the middle. Now all Hazards available for linking are 
			presented in the list in the upper right part of the window. If Hazards have been linked 
			to the selected accident before, these are listed in the lower right part of the window. 
			The Buttons labeled with Add and Remove can be used to link and unlink Hazards to 
			accidents. Add All and Remove All can be used to link all available items or unlink all 
			linked items.
